# Introduction
The film industry is both lucrative and fiercely competitive. In this project, I aim to analyze IMDb's (Internet Movie Database) top 250 movies database, last updated approximately 10 months ago. The objective of this analysis is to explore potential correlations that contribute to a movie's popularity, financial success, and general crtic rating. The three central questions that I will be researching are: Is there a correlation between a movie's production cost and its revenue? Which genres boast the highest IMDb ratings? And finally, which age rating category encompasses the highest number of movies within the top 250? I hope that these findings unveil compelling correlations and aid in the analysis of upcoming future movies.

The 3 questions:
1. Is there a correlation between a movie's production cost and its revenue?
2. Which genres boast the highest IMDb ratings?
3. Which age rating category encompasses the highest number of movies within the top 250?
