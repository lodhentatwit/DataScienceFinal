Exploring a dataset focused on sleep health and lifestyle to identify significant correlations and glean valuable insights.
 
## Draft Intro
The film industry is both lucrative and fiercely competitive. In this project, I aim to analyze IMDb's (Internet Movie Database) top 250 movies database, last updated approximately 10 months ago. This analysis aims to explore potential correlations that contribute to a movie's popularity, financial success, and general crtic rating. The three central questions I will research are: What is the rating distribution of the top 250 movies? Which genres are most prominent? And finally, which age rating category encompasses the highest number of movies within the top 250? I hope that these findings unveil compelling correlations and aid in the analysis of upcoming future movies.

The 3 questions:
1. What is the rating distribution of the top 250 movies?

2. Which genres are most prominent?

## The Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and published by Chidambara Raju, it was last updated a 10 months ago. Each entry within the CSV file comprehensively details a movie's rank, name, year, rating, genre, age rating, length, budget, global box office revenue, cast, director, and writer. Extracted from www.imdb.com, one of the largest online databases for movies and television shows, the IMDb rating within the dataset serves as a widely accepted benchmark for gauging the popularity and success of a movie.

## Methodology
The primary programming language for this analysis is Python, with the open-source Jupyter notebook serving as the integrated development environment (IDE). Within the Python ecosystem, key libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas will be used. These libraries facilitate data cleaning, efficient organization, extraction of essential information, and the seamless creation of informative graphs.
